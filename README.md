# Simply JS 📘

A beginner-friendly JavaScript guide written as an Obsidian vault.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, install these two applications:

1. **[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)** — A markdown note-taking app (for reading the notes)
2. **[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** — A code editor (for writing and running code)

## Setting Up Obsidian

1. Download and install Obsidian from [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/)
2. Open Obsidian and click **"Open folder as vault"**
3. Navigate to and select this `simply-js` folder
4. Once opened, you'll see all the notes in the left sidebar

> 💡 **Tip:** Obsidian renders markdown beautifully and handles internal links between notes. This makes navigating the guide seamless!

## Setting Up VS Code

1. Download and install VS Code from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Install the **"Code Runner"** extension (optional, but helpful for running JS quickly)
3. Open this `simply-js` folder in VS Code
4. Create your practice files inside the `Program Examples/` folder
