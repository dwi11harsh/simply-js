We'll go in detail later but for now read this following definition of JS

<span style="color:rgb(255, 255, 0)">JavaScript is a lightweight interpreted (or just in time compiled) programming language with first class functions.</span> 

- **Lightweight:** uses less computational resources
- **First Class**: we can pass in function as an argument into another function
- Neither compiled and nor interpreted( or not completely)

### Steps in which V8 reads JS code
1. **Parsing**: Source code is parsed and converted into Abstract Syntax Tree (or AST for short), this represents the syntactical structure of entire code.
2. **Ignitions Interpreter:** this converts the AST into byte code (an intermediate code which will then be executed)
3. **Sparkplug Compiler**: This is a non-optimised compiler and executes the byte code in machine (its job is to convert the frequently used functions into machine code)
4. **Maglev Compiler**: This does some optimisations. It uses codes given by sparkplug compiler and does optimisations on top of that.
5. **Turbofan Compiler:** Main compiler of V8, it takes byte code and does advanced optimisations and generates highly-optimised machine code
6. **Execution**

### Another Definition of JS

<span style="color:rgb(255, 255, 0)">JavaScript is a prototype based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic-language supporting Object-oriented, imperative and declarative style of programming</span> 

- **Prototype Based**: in order to make the objects we do not have to implement their classes first, we can directly make objects and everything in JS is objects
- **Multi-paradigm:** there are multiple methodologies available to write JS codes (like Object-oriented, imperative and declarative).
- **Imperative Programming:** a style of programming in which every step which is to be performed is given in as much detail as possible. This is also called **Procedural Programming.**
- **Declarative Programming:** a style of programming in which not every step is detailed and we directly tell about the results. This is also called **Functional Programming.**
- **Dynamic Language:** that performs many programming behaviours at runtime rather than at compile time
- **Single Threaded:** synchronous code execution (I'll explain this later as to how JS is also executes asynchronous codes)
