During 60s, American defence department introduced ARPANET. This project was based on packet switching and was the first computer network ever created. ARPANET stands for Advanced Research Projects Agency Network, and it was this network that implements TCP/IP protocol which is still being used by the internet of present.

> TCP/IP is the network suite which allows two separate computers to communicate with each other

ARPANET consisted of 111 computers connected to each other through cables as shown in the following diagram:

Then comes in a scientist from CERN labs, Tim Berners Lee, and coins the term _World Wide Web_. He said that there will be a set of machines(known as servers these days) which will contain a number of files (web pages) and will be served through the connections to different computers.

Tim then went ahead and conceptualised some of the things which I was shocked to know about:

1. HTML
2. HTTP
3. Browser
4. Server

World's first website created by Tim Berners Lee looked like this:

The blue highlighted text that you can see here is called the **Hypertext**, and when you click at this, you get directed to another page and hence these links are called **Hyperlinks**.

> You might even get surprised to know that some the great researchers of this era still just use html to create their websites and looks the same as the very first website that was ever created. [[https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~thc/|Here]] is an example of Thomas H. Cormen who wrote Introduction to Algorithm (bible of Algorithms)

These web pages are not yet dynamic/interactive. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape|Netscape]] (a browser company) thought the need to make these web pages interactive and they hired Brendan Eich (started Mozilla firefox) to make the interpreter for **scheme** language. After some discussions this idea was discarded.

The folks from netscape came to an agreement to create a language which is easy to learn as their main goal was to target the design community. And also their version 2.0 launch was up and coming soon so they asked Brendan Eich to quickly come up with a language which would be able to accomplish all of their goals.

Brendan Eich stopped working on scheme-interpreter and created the first prototype of **Mocha** in 10 days. Brendan had some experience with other languages and they were the one to inspire the syntax of Mocha, these languages were Java, Scheme, Self, AW and Pearl.

Mocha was dynamically typed Object-based (can create object without worrying about creating the classes as they come pre-implemented) language.

In september 1999 the name Mocha was changed to **Livescript**. But, since Java was way popular back then, Netscape and Sun Microsystems (creator company of Java) made a deal and renamed Livescript to **JavaScript** with the purpose of using the fame of already popular Java language.

Microsoft (after the launch of Netscape Navigator 2.0) also launched their own browser called Internet Explorer and their scripting language was **JScript**. This was a great problem for the developers of that time. After the entire [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars| Era of browser wars]] (Netscape was finished), the task of standardising these scripting languages was given to ECMA International Technical committee in November 1996. Since the name JavaScript was a partner deal between netscape and Sun Microsystems, the name given to this new standard language was **ECMAScript**(and to this day the actual name of this language is still ecmascript and not javascript).

After the standardisation, each browser company started implementing their own engines to interpret JS. Some of the examples are as follows:
1. Chrome uses V8 engine
2. Firefox uses SpiderMonkey
3. Safari uses JavaScriptCore (also known as Nitro or SquirrelFish )

After this, another major turn-point in this journey comes when in 2009 Ryan Dahl makes NodeJS. This is an engine that can run JavaScript outside the browser. This introduced a bunch of tech stacks which are being used these days, some of these are:
1. MERN
2. MEVN
3. MEAN
4. Next.js
5. T3 Stack
6. Jam Stack
